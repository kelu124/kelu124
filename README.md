### Hi there 👋

- 😄 I'm LJ, aka Kelu Ghosh or @kelu124. ;)
  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open projects, ai/llms, ultrasound stuff. You'll see my repos ;)
  - ⚡ Check more on my ultrasound pages: http://un0rick.cc/
  - 💥 I'm on Hackaday too blowing stuff up : https://hackaday.io/kelu124
  - 🏫 Poor quality papers at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luc-Jonveaux
  - Website for fun stuff at [KGhosh.me](https://kghosh.me/)
- 📰 Substack : [https://kghosh.substack.com/](https://substack.kghosh.me/) - trying to do to futurism
- 🌱 I got back into coding in .. early 90s, testing BASIC on the Apple ][ my father used to write his thesis. Since, I've tested a few languages, broken a few things but hopefully built more].
    
- 📫 More on recent ultrasound hardware:
  - When it comes to ultrasound, the latest stable release is **the [pic0rick](https://github.com/kelu124/pic0rick/)** - based on a raspberry pico
- Past experiences (not maintained anymore) are:
  - The initial [beaglebone board, Murgen](https://github.com/kelu124/murgen-dev-kit)
  - The [ultrasound modules](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/) 
  - The first fpga board, [un0rick](https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick) - large and efficient
  - Then the [lit3rick](https://github.com/kelu124/lit3rick/)
  - Then the [lit3-32](https://github.com/kelu124/lit3rick/tree/lit3-32), using more gain
  - Along with [PMOD-modules](https://github.com/kelu124/PMOD_rp2040)
  - A fast [rp2040 acq board](https://github.com/kelu124/0xa5eded)
  - And plenty of other stuff ( [AD8332 dev board](https://github.com/kelu124/AD8332-devboard), [FT600 PMOD](https://github.com/kelu124/ft600), [HV9150 HV Source](https://github.com/kelu124/HV9150DevKit), ... )

- Backlog of projects to be done
  - A [PIC32A](https://github.com/kelu124/pic32arick) ultrasound board ;) 
  - A [rp2040/FT600 board](https://github.com/kelu124/oshmri/tree/main/hardware/13.FT600/v0.4)

- 💬  I'm into
  - open source, especially hardware, been dabbling cofounder of the echOpen association in 2014, but also promoting the use of open-source ultrasound hardware to give affordable, accessible tools to students and researchers
  - retroengineering
  - Futures-gazing
  - understanding how stuff work
  - learning - big fan of MOOCs too =)
